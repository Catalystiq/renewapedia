Topic: Green energy initiatives are important to reduce the negative effects of fossil-fuels on the environment. There are many renewable energy programs promoted and listed by the Environmental Protection Agency and they promote various incentives for homeowners to include more green and clean energy solutions in their homes. 

Challenge: Develop a website that compiles information for homeowners on green and clean energy home solutions and other initiatives. The website should provide basic information, cost, tax rebate information, and clean/green energy practices.
